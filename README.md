## Portfolio

This project is my portfolio that can be seen on [sametmutevelli.com](https://sametmutevelli.com "Samet Mutevelli's Portfolio").

The 'Welcome' component features the languages, frameworks, and libraries I am familiar with. The logos are compiled in single image file and displayed on the page with CSS Sprite technique.

The 'Portfolio' component features an highlight of the applications I have built.

Finally, the 'Blog' component features my blog posts published on [samet.web.tr](https://samet.web.tr "Samet Mutevelli's Personal Blog") where I write on technical topics I find useful and interesting. The posts are fetched utilizing a package I am working on that exposes WordPress's REST API via a custom React Hook library called `use-wp`.
